#The State of Animation in React

A talk on the past, the present and the future of animation, and the place React can potentially take in this. I will be focusing on a few experiments on animation I've done, specifically: react-tween-state, react-state-stream and some unreleased transition-group related thoughts and work.

react tween state moving to spring.
can embelish with tweens for very little cost
uses mixin, which need reworked as they will be depricated


perfromance
aim for performance, go simple if needs be for fps
