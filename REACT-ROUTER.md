#React Router

Since May 2014 over 100 people have contributed code to React Router and many, many more have filed issues, given talks, and used the router in both server and client environments. It has been mine and Ryan's privilege to work with and learn from these wonderful people and to guide the direction of a library that we hope will help us all build amazing products and tools with React over the next few years.

This year we are introducing support for React Native and we are working closely with the Relay team to ensure the router meets the needs of React developers everywhere React runs. More importantly though, we are focused on bringing great experiences to consumers of applications built using React Router. In this talk, we will discuss how your users can benefit from the many tools the router provides including server-side rendering, real URLs on native devices, and much, much more.
