#Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel

Reactâ€™s unique strength is bringing to JavaScript development some of the benefits previously exclusive to more radically functional languages such as Elm and ClojureScript, without forcing you to completely eschew local state or rewrite code with exclusively immutable data structures. In this talk, Dan will demonstrate how React can be used together with Webpack Hot Module Replacement to create a live editing environment with time travel that supercharges your debugging experience and transforms the way you work on real apps every day.
