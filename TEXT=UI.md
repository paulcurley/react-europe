#Back to Text UI

Paradoxically that today it is easier to create GUI than Text UI. Developer has an arsenal of different GUI libraries and layout engines. When one decides to write Terminal Text UI app he faces obstacles of Text UI DSL Library, imperative layouts, constantly increasing complexity and underdeveloped approaches. In this talk I will show you how to ask browser layout engine for help, how to avoid slavery of DSL and build declarative Text UI using only web-technologies like HTML, JS, CSS and React.
