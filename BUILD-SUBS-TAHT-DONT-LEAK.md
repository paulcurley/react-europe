#Building submarines that don't leak

React provides us with a lot of tools for building components, but isn't prescriptive about how we use those. Objects can have props, state, and instance fields. When is it best to use each? We've heard a lot about pure components, but how do we make pure components when we have to deal with the realities of a stateful world? How do we make more complex components whose props actually represent them? We'll cover how we've answered these questions at Khan Academy, including techniques and patterns to make dealing with large pure components simpler, as well as current open questions.
