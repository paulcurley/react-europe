###inline styles  - micheal chan
react will let you lean css, but deal withh browser inconsitancies?!?
style is not CSS
    dont call it css, its styles in JS
state changes are ui changes

componenets should be reused and not repurposed
    small frags are repurposed, not reused in css
bring state fully into JS, lack of css/style breaks behaviour
use className to toggle
inject styles with style object with conditions
css only deals with global styling not state (selelcted) style

COST 
reafator state styles to js

###capability

variables - import global and reuses
psudo-classes via array length/modulas/etc
psudo elemnts - treat just another element in component
hover - less in css, complex with mouseenter/out events & responsive condtion
Radium solves hover issue along side responsive conditionss

grab bag
colors in sass - 
    Color.js - allows lighten darken etc

layout
    bootstrap etc are great for layout
    dont put classes in component, wrap in a div above with lib classes

###distrubuted components
react-soundplayer - well written example

still quiestions about how teams work with this
questions on perf still to be answered
